js idea:
Model:
	Firstname

	Lastname

There are four validations mentioned above,want to fill the all coloumns,without filling a single coloumn we cannot move to a another page.
and finally there is submit option to click and check the validations.

The firstname should contain only alphabetical characters
The Lastname also should contain only alphabetical characters
The Emailid should be validate with alphanumeric values(using regrex)
The Dateofbirth contain DD/MM/YYYY in this form(using date format)

Time:
Time to create a form:
  21/01/22
Time for styling:
  22/01/2022
Time for validations:
  25/01/22
Styling:
The styling should be done in CSS ,their background color,background image,styling fonts,width,height 

Javascript idea:
	To implement oops concepts in javascripts and implement the validations.
To write a program in a simplest form we are using oops concepts to implement it,Here we are creating a separate classes for easy validations,
Inside a class we are creating a method constructor for looping and create an objects for methods,and call it html to check validations.
